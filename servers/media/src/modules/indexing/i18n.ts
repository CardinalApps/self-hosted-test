    "en": `
Update the state of the currently running indexing operation. This endpoint
is dedicated to controlling the indexing service from the frontend, and
cannot update completed runs.

This endpoint is designed to accept actions. Instead of sending the desired
state, send an action and let the indexing service handle the change
internally. So, you send "stop", and internally the service will terminate
the run and change the state to \`idle\`.

Accepted actions are:

- \`pause\` - Pauses the run after the current file has completed indexing.
The internal state will change to \`paused\`.
- \`resume\` - Resumes a run and continues with the next file. Triggering
resume on a run that isn't paused will have no effect. The internal
state will change to \`indexing\`.
- \`stop\` - Stops a run after the current file has completed indexing. The
internal state will change to \`idle\`, and a new run can be started.

Get one or more files from your index. Depending on the filetype, addtional

  "indexing.delete.description": {
    "en": `
Deindexes one or more files. To "deindex" means to delete the file entity
and all of its derived entities like songs and episodes, and all of their
derived entities like metadata and thumbnails.

Deindexing however does not delete cached static resources on the disk like
the thumbnail files that the server generates when initially indexing
things. Those now stale assets will eventually be deleted by a cleanup cron
job.

If a wildcard (\`*\`) is given as the sole item in the array, all files will
be deindexed. The wildcard method only supports hard deleting, so you must
also set \`hardDelete\` to true to activate it. Only a \`true\` boolean will be
returned when the wildcard operation is done.

By default, this deindexing is a soft delete. To perform a hard delete, set
the \`hardDelete\` param to true.
