## About This Repository

<details>
  <summary>How do I use this repository as someone that wants to build an app that uses Cardinal's APIs?</summary>
  <p>You should develop against the beta release instead of this repo. Use this repo only if you want to develop against latest.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Was this made with AI?</summary>
  <p>No. This is, for better or for worse, all written by a human. Vive la révolution!</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I build the apps?</summary>
  <p>The official builds that are on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/cardinalapps/media-server">Docker Hub</a> are built and published by Cardinal's CI. While you can definitely build and use Docker images using this repository, doing so is out of scope of this repository and there is no orchestration available for it beyond running the pnpm commands yourself one by one.</p>
  <p>Running self-built containers is not offically supported, and this repository may change at any time in ways that break self-build setups.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use this to verify the integrity of the public builds?</summary>
  <p>Sort of? The Media Server binary that you can build with this repository will exactly match the one that is shipped in the public Docker builds.</p>
  <p>But, like other CI things, this is out of scope of this repository.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Something isn't working</summary>
  <p>All self-hosted features should work in the development environment. But since this repo only runs self-hosted apps, Cardinal's cloud services will not function here (you won't be able to log into your Cardinal account in the dev env).</p>
  <p>If you are still having issues with something that should work locally then please create a GitHub issue.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why so few commits?</summary>
  <p>This repository was created in March 2026. Prior to that, this project was closed source. The second commit in this repo is a squashed commit containing all the work since the beginning.</p>
